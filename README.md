# Try-with-Bluebert-model

## Reproduce bluebert model
This project reproduced the bluebert model from https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark. (bluebert_reproduced folder)

## Modify and build pipelines to apply bluebert model on new datasets.
This project transfer the bluebert model into the Pytorch version based on Huggingface and https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert-pytorch. (bluebert_test folder)
